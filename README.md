> Introduction
The Inventory Management System is a software application developed for a dairy shop to streamline their inventory management processes and enhance operational efficiency. The system provides a user-friendly interface using the Python-Tkinter framework and leverages the power of MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of product, employee, and customer data.
